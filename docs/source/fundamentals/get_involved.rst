NVIDIA Developer Preview
========================

*thunder* is developed by teams both at Lightning AI and NVIDIA, and is available to all NVIDIA developers as an experimental developer preview. *thunder* is intended to be the most extensible and empowering framework for NVIDIA engineers, making it as simple as possible to express program transforms, like advanced distributed strategies, and to quickly integrate and test fast kernels. Although *thunder* currently has missing features and “rough edges”, this developer preview is to let the *thunder* team work directly with more NVIDIA developers and ensure it meets their needs.

Since the developer preview is targeted to NVIDIA developers, the current documentation assumes the reader is principally interested in how deep learning programs are run on NVIDIA accelerators.
